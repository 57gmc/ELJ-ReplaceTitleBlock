            // 1. Export a function from unmanaged code that takes a function
            //    pointer and stores the passed in value in a global variable.
            // 2. Call this exported function in this function passing delegate.
            // 3. When unmanaged code needs the services of this managed module
            //    you simply call acrxLoadApp() and by the time acrxLoadApp 
            //    returns  global function pointer is initialized to point to
            //    the C# delegate.
