# ELJ-ReplaceTitleBlock

TitleBlockChange is an AutoCAD command that changes the Title Block on the active drawing and 
it tries to copy all of the attributes from the old Title Block to the new one.

Attributes common to both the old block and the new one will be retained. 
All others will be empty in the new block.
